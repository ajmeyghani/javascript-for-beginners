/**
 * Goal of the session:
 * Look at different models for representing problems.
 * That is the classical approach vs composition
 * In other words: hierarchy (classical/prototypal) vs mixins(functional composition)
 *
 * Explore the basics: functions, constructors, objects and prototypes
 *
 * Explore design models: class-oriented, single-ancestry chains, single-prototype delegation
 *
 * Explore mixins
